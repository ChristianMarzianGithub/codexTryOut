### ðŸš€ Output Requirements
1. Complete code for backend, frontend, and Dockerfiles.  
2. `docker-compose.yml` to run both containers locally.  
3. Clear build and run instructions.  
4. Step-by-step deployment guide for **Google Cloud Run**, including:
   - How to build container images
   - How to push to **Google Artifact Registry**
   - How to deploy each service (frontend and backend) to Cloud Run  
   - How to configure CORS and environment variables

---

### ðŸ’¡ Implementation Notes
- Use clean, modular, and commented code.
- The backend should have an `/api` base path.
- Use Spring profiles or `.env` files for configuration.
- Frontend should read backend API URL from environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_URL`).
- Optimize Docker images (use multi-stage builds).
